# Phenology Model in Google Earth Engine
## Overview
This project explores phenology mapping by applying harmonic time series analysis to the MODIS EVI dataset. Using Google Earth Engine, the seasonal patterns of vegetation were identified and visualized. The project creates a vivid map of vegetation seasonality, showcasing:

Timing of phenological stages (e.g., greening, senescence)
- Strength of seasonal cycles
- Baseline vegetation levels

## Why This Matters
Phenology—the study of seasonal biological events—is critical for understanding ecosystem health, climate impacts, and agricultural trends. This project demonstrates how remote sensing and harmonic regression can provide actionable insights into these phenomena.

## Key Features
- Harmonic Regression: Models seasonal cycles using sinusoidal components.
- MODIS EVI Data: Uses Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the MOD13A1 dataset.
- Seasonality Visualization: Creates HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value) visualizations of phenological patterns.
- Dynamic Mapping: Outputs RGB maps showing timing, intensity, and productivity of vegetation.

## Technologies Used
- Google Earth Engine: For processing and analyzing remote sensing data.
- MODIS/MOD13A1 Dataset: Provides vegetation indices like EVI.
- JavaScript API: Used to implement harmonic time series analysis in GEE.

## Applications
- Climate Change Studies: Monitor phenological shifts due to global warming.
- Agriculture: Plan planting/harvesting schedules based on seasonal trends.
- Biodiversity Conservation: Track vegetation changes affecting ecosystems.
